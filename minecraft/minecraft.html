<p><h2 class="title">More Minecraft Screenshots</h2></p>
<p>Here are a few more screenshots me and my friends collected while on our server over<br>
winter break. We took pictures of any moments we could so we could remember our time spent<br>
on here, since we knew that once classes started up again we wouldn't be able to play as much<br>
as we had been.</p>

<p>Our servers we create and play on only last two or three months before we either get too<br>
busy to play or just lose interest in the world, but it is still pretty nice to look back on<br>
these screenshots to remember the times we had on one particular world together.</p>
